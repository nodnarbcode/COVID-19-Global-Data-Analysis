# COVID-19-Global-Data-Analysis

## Project Summary
This project presents a comprehensive data analysis and visualization of the global COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and fatality rates across different countries. By leveraging global datasets, the study identifies key trends, explores inter-variable correlations, and highlights country-specific case studies such as the United Kingdom to assess the pandemicâ€™s impact. The analysis provides valuable insights for understanding the progression of COVID-19 and informs future public health planning and emergency preparedness.

## Key Questions
1. How did COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries evolve over time in the United Kingdom, and what patterns emerged across multiple waves?
2. Which countries recorded the highest number of confirmed cases, and what factors contributed to their high case counts?
3. How did the progression of confirmed cases differ among the top 5 most affected countries, and what does this reveal about the timing and scale of outbreaks?
4. What do global trends in daily new COVID-19 cases reveal about the pace and peaks of the pandemic across different time periods?
5. Which countries had the highest case fatality rates, and how did healthcare infrastructure and demographic factors influence these outcomes?
6. What correlations exist between confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries, and what do these relationships indicate about the effectiveness of pandemic response efforts?
7. How did monthly trends in new COVID-19 cases help identify long-term patterns and assess the impact of variants and seasonal factors?

## Tools
